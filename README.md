# Overview
This project consists of a program that stores data for passwords and usernames and grants access to the user; It also implements a function that shows the strength of the password chosen by the user.
The software demonstrates functions, classes, loops, variables, lists, conditionals, and expressions to show a deep understanding of the language and its strengths. 

{Purpose for writing this software.}
The purpose of this project was to help ade in the learning process of c++ and help me learn as a developer. This project was to help with my understanding of how classes, functions, and loops work.

# Development Environment
Xcode software

{language and libraries.}
C++ is a wonderful language that implements efficiency, and performance. The learning curve is a little tricky but it is made for the best development out there. 
 Libraries:
#include <iostream> tells the preprocessor to include these header file in the program.
#include <ctype.h> declares a set of functions to classify (and transform) individual characters.
#include <string.h> defines one variable type, one macro, and various functions for manipulating arrays of characters.
#include <stdbool.h> allows you to use bool as a Boolean data type.

# Future Work
Adding a file read and write system for the passwords and usernames. 
Adding the password straight function to the create new password section of the program. 

{Things that need to be fixed, improve and add in the future.}
* Item 1 Separate classes into different folders.
* Item 2 Add a new account method.
